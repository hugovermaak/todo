# A Todo application

## Getting started

After cloning the repo, run `bun install` or `npm install` or `yarn install` then you can run the application using `bun run dev` or `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

I am using Dexie as the mechanism for state management.
I know I can wrap the Dexie functionality in its own hook, I just ran out of time getting to it.

It is also possible to wrap it all in another state management solution like Zustand or Redux or Reciol.

I wanted to add appropriate animations and do some cleanup, but ran out of time :(
